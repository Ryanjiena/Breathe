    "description": "Volume² is an advanced Windows volume control, which can be used as a complete replacement for the standard Windows volume control. Volume² provides easy to configure options to assign keyboard hotkeys and mouse for toggling system volume and allows scheduling the execution of applications or changes in sound configurations. Volume² comes with a multi-lingual interface and supports English, Russian, Greek, Chinese, Armenian, and other. What makes Volume² better than the default Windows mixer is it’s ability to provide mouse wheel, hotkey and scheduling support for changing volume options.",
