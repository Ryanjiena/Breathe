    "description": "SearchMyFiles is an alternative to the standard \"Search For Files And Folders\" module of Windows. It allows you to easily search files in your system by wildcard, by last modified/created/last accessed time, by file attributes, by file content (text or binary search), and by the file size. SearchMyFiles allows you to make a very accurate search that cannot be done with Windows search. For Example: You can search all files created in the last 10 minutes with size between 500 and 700 bytes. After you made a search, you can select one or more files, and save the list into text/html/csv/xml file, or copy the list to the clipboard. SearchMyFiles is portable, and you can use it from a USB flash drive without leaving traces in the Registry of the scanned computer.",
